Hi Team,

I am new to AWS and I just started learning/exploring resources of different services available on AWS. Since i am not aware of the charges for the uses of the resources and i am still learning the offerings, I would request to waive off the bill.

I will make sure that I am utilizing the services and its resources judiciously in the future.

Thanks
